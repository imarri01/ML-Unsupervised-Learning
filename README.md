## Introduction

Unsupervised learning is a category of machine learning that deals with unlabeled data. The objective is to uncover hidden patterns and intrinsic structures within the data. This repository showcases various unsupervised learning techniques and provides practical examples to help you understand and apply these methods.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imarri01/ML-Unsupervised-Learning.git
    cd ML-Unsupervised-Learning
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

To explore the notebooks and scripts in this repository, ensure your virtual environment is activated, then launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the project folder and open the desired notebook to get started.
