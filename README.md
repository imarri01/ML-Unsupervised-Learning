# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning - Project

Welcome to the **Unsupervised Learning - Project** notebook! This project showcases the application of various unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and structures in the "Wholesale Data" dataset. This dataset includes annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product categories by clients of a wholesale distributor.
